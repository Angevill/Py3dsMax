/*
Versioning is handled through a couple of files and a pre-build event 
to allow svn revision numbers to automatically be included/incremented.

version.h: this is an auto-generated file with the build date and svn 
	revision number of the project.It is included throughout the project 
	to get the version and build info it defines.

version_h_template.txt: this is where version numbers should be
	incremened by hand.	This file is read by subwcrev.exe which spits
	out version.h during a pre-build event.
